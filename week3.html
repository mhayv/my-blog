        <h2>Week Three Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
            <p class="small">Something that went well was the in-depth research, and how it helped in ideation for my potential solution. I think I did a lot of case studies, analysis, and field reviews throughout this week, and it really helped me to understand the current market surrounding this topic, and how I could implement something that would help solve my problem statement.</p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">Unfortunately I did not complete this weeks sprint goal. This week, I aimed to do user testing on some lo-fi prototypes, and then start working on a lo-fi figma wireframe. This was not accomplished because I realized there was a lot more meaningful research, field review, proof of concept work that I need to do before I should commit to an idea. </p>

        <h3>3. What didnt go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">Still from last week, something that has not gone well is overestimating the workload. I keep listing huge long tasks everyday, but don’t complete it and it ends up piling on to the next day. It felt a bit intimidating to see my to-do list only grow longer, instead of get smaller. I also was unable to do any lo-fi testing at all this week, which was my main sprint goal. I realized the importance of field review and proof of concept working, and that they would take a bit more time than expected a bit late. I did not plan this properly, so it ended up shifting my timeline a bit. Allowing time for any extra work that may come up is something I need to start implementing in my term timeline so I can avoid the same mistakes. </p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">Though I should have implemented this already, I realize I did not adjust my week 3 schedule effectively after my week 2 reflection. My main learning is still that I need to give extra working time for tasks so I don’t rush through them and end up with work that I am not entirely sure of</p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">For the following sprint, I will properly lay out my work time and also write in my personal journal an estimated time per task, so I can do work within this time, and then move on [this is better since I can still go back to rework if necessary]</p>
