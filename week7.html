        <h2>Week Seven Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small"> One aspect that did go pretty well this week was how smoothly the coding process went once I
            finally started. I think I've gotten more used to coding now, and I understand what I'm working on much more
            compared to before. This improvement helped make the coding process feel a little less daunting [for future
            coding days to come], and more manageable.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">Truthfully, one of the challenges I faced was the unwillingness to start coding the app. I felt
            like I didn't know enough to start, which led me to focusing on other work. I found it ironic that when I
            actually started, it was less difficult than I made it out to be. This delay of course, shortened the
            timeline I had to work on the code, so it's frustrating that this really could have been avoided, had I just
            gotten over the worry and just started. Additionally to this, I intended to create a detailed daily work
            plan to help guide my progress, but I did not follow through with it over last weekend, causing this weeks
            workflow unstructured and unorganized.
        </p>

        <h3>3. What didn&#39;t go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">A key area that I constantly need to work on is task management and prioritization. I keep
            focusing my time on other parts of the project, mainly as a way to avoid working on the coding aspect of the
            project. I've learned that I know more than I realize, so it was just wasteful to push these tasks away, as
            confronting them earlier would have lead to a more productive work week.</p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">Starting the topic searching, I just chose the topics that I usually go for [which is
            environmental regeneration and arts and cultural expression, but I don&#39;t really do civic participation,
            just chose this to try out something new] and from there I was just stuck, since these are topics I have
            overdone in the past. Going back and actually brainstorming personal daily challenges helped me choose a
            topic that I would relate to. What I have learnt from this was being more thorough with brainstorming really
            helped set up for choosing a topic I would be able to empathise with.
        </p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">For the final sprint, I plan to implement a more structured and intentional schedule.
            Specifically, I will organize a daily [potentially an hourly?] checklist to help break my project schedule
            into a manageable and realistic timeline, trying to make sure that I give an equal amount of attention
            across the collateral.</p>


        <h2>Week Seven Daily Stand Ups</h2>
        <h4 class="small">&#39;&#39;What did I do yesterday, What I will do today, Impediments and blockers?&#39;&#39;
        </h4>

        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">Over the weekend, I worked on unfinished work to set up for the next two weeks of coding.
            Today, I will work on the type brief and clean up my hi-fi.</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I polished my type poster a bit more [nearly done] and tweaked the hi-fi according
            to feedback during the WIP. Today, I will set up my repo, and try to start coding. No blockers.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p class="small">yesterday I set up my code file and ended up just working more on the type brief. Today I will
            continue coding, finalize the type brief, and set up other collateral [case study, final presentation]. No
            blockers.</p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday I finished my type poster, and did a bit of work catchup. Today, I will organize and
            submit my type brief collateral, and try to get a steady start on coding. No blockers.</p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I submitted my type brief, and did some code setup. Today I will work on the main
            frames of the pages I will be coding, and over the weekend work on the presentation and case study. No
            blockers. | Edit : I had to re-submit, and had issues with deploying my type site, so that took up a bit of
            my work time</p>
