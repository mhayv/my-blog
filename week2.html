        <h2>Week Two Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
            <p class="small">I referred to last terms work and looked at the work templates we were given. I did a lot of that work to
            build and understand my persona and target audience, and I feel like that helped a lot when I went to work
            on my interviews. The work templates for analysing the interview answers [such as affinity maps, thematic
            analysis (which is currently still underway..)], also helped when I had to find insights from the results.
            It felt satisfying to see how habits, processes, and templates from the previous term have helped me in
            developing this terms work - I feel they made this week’s work more manageable. </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">My sprint goal was to complete and analyse interviews with people in my target audience, so I have
            accomplished this weeks sprint goal. I’ve done this through having questions set up and interviews conducted
            early in the week, leaving lots of time for analysis later on.</p>

        <h3>3. What didnt go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">I think I may have overestimated how long certain processes would take me [for example, thematic analysis is
            taking more time than I expected], so I’d say being overly ambitious with what I could achieve within each
            week, and each day was something that didn’t go so well. I felt a bit rushed with the timeline I set for
            myself, since the week was going by quite quickly, but I was still working on the same few tasks.</p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">I’ve learned that I should set out tasks with more spacing, in case I do take more time than anticipated to
            complete it. This way, I won’t put unnecessary time pressure on myself.</p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">For the next sprint, I will readjust my term plan, so I can stay flexible if tasks end up taking a longer
            time than expected. I’ll also try to organise workload with tasks that take a long time to be completed in
            the earlier part of the week, so I don’t rush it to the end of the week.</p>

        <h2>Week Two Daily Stand Ups</h2>
        <h4 class="small">&#39;&#39;What did I do yesterday, What I will do today, Impediments and blockers?&#39;&#39;
        </h4>

        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">Over the weekend, I cleaned up my Figma board, set interview questions, and completed an
            empathy map and persona. Today, I will do some interviews, set up my interview answer organizer, and analyse
            some of the answers. Mainly scheduling differences was the blocker today - not everyone I needed to
            interview was on campus, so I will be finishing interviews tomorrow.</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I cleaned up my interview questions, and completed half of my interviews. Today I
            will finish the other half of my interviews, start working on thematic analysis on the answers, and find
            insights from there. No blockers today.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I finished all my interviews, and started working on thematic analysis. I also
            worked on the affinity map. Today, I will continue working on thematic analysis, organising the insights
            founded, and then put everything into the WIP presentation. I will also finish the current state user
            journey. No blockers.</p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I completed the current state user journey, found my first interview insights, and
            did a little more work on thematic analysis. Today, I will have my WIP 01 serssion, and then apply the
            feedback to my current work. I'll also start competitor research for any potential solutions. No blockers.
        </p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I started competitor research after noting down feedback and suggestions from the
            WIP 01 session. Today, I will complete unfinished work, organize my Figma, and update my blog. Over the
            weekend, I plan to complete my competitor research, and create some lo-fi paper prototypes for user testing
            in preparation for next week. No blockers.</p>
