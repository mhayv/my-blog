        <h2>Week One Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">What went well this week was choosing and refining a topic and problem statement. I was quite
            stuck in choosing a topic from the list of areas of inquiry to consider, so I went back and fully
            brainstormed what challenges I face in my daily life. That really helped me choose something that I would
            actually be interested in, since I am also affected by this problem. I also took a different approach from
            last term, by writing out my planning and idea refining on my iPad, instead of just typing on my laptop.
            This felt more free, and helped me to write down my thoughts more openly. This helped a lot when I was
            refining my current problem statement.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">My sprint goal was to choose a topic and to have a starting problem statement [next week is
            ideally, setting an actionable problem statement], and I have achieved this through exploring potential
            topics, narrowing in on certain ideas within a chosen topic [civic participation -> local events
            participation], and then refining the problem statement.
        </p>

        <h3>3. What didn&#39;t go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">It took longer than I would have liked to settle on a topic that I wanted to explore. Up until
            Thursday [after mentoring], I was doing research on two potential topics &#39;civic participation&#39;, and
            &#39;environmental regeneration&#39;, so that took away the time I could have spent focusng on just one
            topic [if I had just chosen something from the get go]. I think part of the hold back [on choosing a topic]
            was because of being unsure if my research was actually aligning with the brief.</p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">Starting the topic searching, I just chose the topics that I usually go for [which is
            environmental regeneration and arts and cultural expression, but I don&#39;t really do civic participation,
            just chose this to try out something new] and from there I was just stuck, since these are topics I have
            overdone in the past. Going back and actually brainstorming personal daily challenges helped me choose a
            topic that I would relate to. What I have learnt from this was being more thorough with brainstorming really
            helped set up for choosing a topic I would be able to empathise with.
        </p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">For the following sprint, I will set up an actionable problem statement [potentially a &#39;How
            Might We&#39;], start UX research and interviews, and after gaining insights on the interview results,
            mapping out wireframes and current user journeys. </p>



        <h2>Week One Daily Stand Ups</h2>
        <h4 class="small">&#39;&#39;What did I do yesterday, What I will do today, Impediments and blockers?&#39;&#39;
        </h4>

        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">Today I read through the brief, and chose three topics to start looking at, I also did some
            light research on these topics. A blocker from this was I felt unsure at times on what exactly I was
            supposed to research regarding these topics. </p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Monday, I did some light research on environmental regeneration and civic participation. I
            mainly looked at energy usage of young people in New Zealand, and how people struggle to keep up with local
            / community news and events. Today I listed down some assumptions I have on these topics. There was not so
            much of a blocker.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Tuesday I mainly just listed my assumptions on the topics I was doing research on. Today I
            will draft some problem statements and complete the first four weeks of term planning. I feel like there
            isn&#39;t really feeling a connection with my current topic [of just &#39;local news updates&#39; and
            &#39;energy usage&#39;], so I will also go back to brainstorming, listing my daily challenges in life, and
            from that, choose a topic I could relate to. A blocker of this would be having to go back through the
            choosing process, but in the end I think this will be helpful to me anyways.</p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Wednesday, I drafted a few problem statements on the topics I narrowed down to, and started
            focusing a bit more towards the civic participation topic. Today, I will further refine the idea of
            &#39;local / community participation&#39;, and look at examples of local crafts events [this is the interest
            I think I will be focusing on] in Auckland. There was not too much of a blocker.</p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Thursday I did local craft event research, and also explored why people struggle with
            hearing about the events, and what keeps people from participating, and hearing about these events. Today, I
            will organize the work I have done so far, and upload the work I done on my iPad. The overall blocker from
            this week was from me taking a long time to settle on a topic, leading me to do research on more than just
            one, when I could have done targeted research from earlier in the week. This took a bit of my time, and
            caused me to work backwards, but in the end, I was able to come to a topic I would be interested in and be
            able to empathise with. </p>
