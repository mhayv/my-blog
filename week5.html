        <h2>Week Five Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
            <p class="small">Something that I think went well was the referencing I did  when I was working on branding. There was a lot of different works I could take inspiration from to help build and establish my own brand. It felt really satisfying to have such a clear guideline and idea for my visual branding. The constant looking back to other existing platforms and work that had applied this visual style really helped me to also really integrate the style, and hopefully translate it in my own visual branding. </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">My sprint goal this week was to establish my visual brand and work on the styleguide + brand guidelines, so I can say that I accomplished this weeks goal. This is because I was able to complete visual establishing, and I have a start on both of the styleguide and brand guidelines. </p>

        <h3>3. What didnt go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">This week went relitabely smooth in terms of progress, as there weren’t really any major blockers [like how it’s been for the past few weeks]. Work went pretty smooth, although I feel I could have organized my tasks in a way that would help me keep the same momentum, since towards the end of the week I slowed down a bit. </p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">Maintaining a good work momentum, especially during less structured weeks, or weeks that don’t have any due dates would be something I could improve on. Rather than just having a week goal, I found it helpful to break everything up into tasks, and keep note of the estimated time each task would take, so I could be aware of how much time I would need to set aside per task.</p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">For the next sprint, [which is focusing on Hi-fi development, testing, and finalizing the brand guidelines and style guide] I'll continue listing out the estimated time per task to help me visualize how long each task will probably take, and to help keep my progress momentum consistent.
