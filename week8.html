        <h2>Week Eight Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">Something that went very well this week was the pace I worked at. The personal due dates and in-depth planner really helped me focus on what I needed to work on for each day. I also was able to code pretty smoothly with the help of past lecture recordings. It felt accomplishing to see the progression of my app, and see it actually feel a bit more real as a coded project. </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">My final sprint goal is to complete all unfinished works, as well as submit the final works. I finished the bulk of my work a day prior to submission [Friday left for any cleanup], so I definitely accomplished this weeks sprint goal :3 </p>

        <h3>3. What didnt go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">Something that did not go well this week would be my final presentation. I blanked out throughout the most part of it, and it was hard since I've usually been able to just continue talking through my blanks. This final presentation did not match the quality of previous presentations, so I am very frustrated with how this went. I recently noticed I've suddenly gotten extremely anxious over presenting, it just feels weird since I've not worried so much like this before. At the moment, I'm not sure what caused this, or how to really get over it. I am hoping the break, and stepping away from the mindset will at least allow me to stop overthinking it.</p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">The big thing that definitely needs improvement was presentations. I usually would be fine with just a day of preparation, but I think I relied too much on the fact, and underestimated the nerves I was feeling this time. I didn't prepare for what I could do had I blanked out, and the first pause really threw me off my ..'flow'.</p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">For the next terms, I will stick with the general workflow I had built. This is setting early
            deadlines, and breaking the workload into detailed daily tasks to help me keep momentum and stay on track.
            On top of this, I want to also practice for more time prior to presentations.</p>

        <h2>Week Eight Daily Stand Ups</h2>
        <h4 class="small">&#39;&#39;What did I do yesterday, What I will do today, Impediments and blockers?&#39;&#39;
        </h4>
        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Friday, and over the weekend, I focused on starting the base code, worked on the
            presentation flow, and completed most of my unfinished tasks. I also created a personal in-depth week plan
            to follow as a working guideline. Today I will focus on coding my database, and working more on my slide
            deck. I guess a blocker would be my unsureness of my database, but I think I can work around this by
            rewatching some past lectures. I plan to have a mentoring session on my current code on Tuesday for help on
            what could be improved.</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I coded up to my filter screen, and got started on the database of my code
            [rewatching past lectures as a refresh]. I also worked a little on my presentation, and created a case study
            project. Today, I will continue working on the code [and then get mentoring at 1pm], finish my presentation
            deck (planning to quickly mock-up some posters maybe for the campaign section), work a bit more on the case
            study [add screens that I can from the presentation deck], and then practice in preparation for tomorrows
            proposal. No blockers.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I fixed most of my database, set up my campaign collateral, mockups, and finalized
            my proposal slides. I ended up not doing mentoring since I figured out my initial database issue. Today I
            will have my presentation, and then finalize my code, case study, and work on the CMS deliverables. No
            blockers. </p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday I had my final presentation, and worked on case study. Today, I will finish my code,
            run it through validators, as well as finish my case study and clean up my documentation. I will also clean
            up the CMS deliverables, and work towards submitting a bit earlier in the day on Friday. No blockers. </p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
