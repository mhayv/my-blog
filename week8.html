        <h2>Week Eight Daily Stand Ups</h2>

        </h4>

        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Friday, and over the weekend, I focused on starting the base code, worked on the presentation flow, and completed most of my unfinished tasks. I also created a personal in-depth week plan to follow as a working guideline. Today I will focus on coding my database, and working more on my slide deck. I guess a blocker would be my unsureness of my database, but I think I can work around this by rewatching some past lectures. I plan to have a mentoring session on my current code on Tuesday for help on what could be improved.</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I coded up to my filter screen, and got started on the database of my code [rewatching past lectures as a refresh]. I also worked a little on my presentation, and created a case study project. Today, I will continue working on the code (and then get mentoring at 1pm], finish my presentation deck (planning to quickly mock-up some posters maybe for the campaign section), work a bit more on the case study [add screens that I can from the presentation deck], and then practice in preparation for tomorrows proposal. No blockers.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday, I fixed most of my database, set up my campaign collateral, mockups, and finalized my proposal slides. I ended up not doing mentoring since I figured out my database issue. Today I will have my presentation, and then finalize my code, case study, and work on the CMS deliverables. No blockers. </p>
