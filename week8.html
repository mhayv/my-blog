        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">On Friday, and over the weekend, I focused on starting the base code, worked on the presentation flow, and completed most of my unfinished tasks. I also created a personal in-depth week plan to follow as a working guideline. Today I will focus on coding my database, and working more on my slide deck. I guess a blocker would be my unsureness of my database, but I think I can work around this by rewatching some past lectures. I plan to have a mentoring session on my current code on Tuesday for help on what could be improved.</p>
