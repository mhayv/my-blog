        <h2>Week Five Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">Focusing on establishing my brand - it was pretty easy to see how I could apply this to my
            wireframes, so it made the hi-fi development pretty smooth in that sense. I felt pretty motivated seeing how
            the brand came more 'to life' and everything looked pretty cohesive on the hi-fi. It was cool to see the big
            difference between the lo-fi wireframes and hi-fi. </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">This weeks sprint goal was to get my hi-fi done, and tested. I was able to user test on two
            people, so yes, this weeks goal was accomplished. With that said, I feel it would have been better if I was
            able to test more people at an earlier stage of the week. [Though the testing I did was still pretty
            helpful].</p>

        <h3>3. What didnt go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">What didn't go well was the scheduling. I ended up doing user testing much later than I had
            planned [I wanted to user test by Wednesday, but only got around to it on Thursday], which meant I wasn't
            able to apply all the feedback by the time the WIP presentation came around. It was a bit frustrating,
            because I felt that the feedback I got so late, would have addressed a few things mentioned during the WIP
            [as in, I could have fixed things before presenting everything]. It was also frustrating, because last
            project I was able to test on four people in one go, so I know how much the user testing really helps in the
            development of the hi-fi. This last testing was because of schedule changes and underestimating how long
            mentoring feedback would have taken to apply.</p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">The main thing I learnt from this week was the importance of being more flexible in my
            schedule. Having a backup plan [like just user testing on what I had early in the week instead of trying to
            get everything done] would have helped reduce the rush I felt towards the end of the week. </p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">Moving forward, I'd say I will try to be more aware of unexpected schedule changes and tasks
            that may pop up within the sprint week. The next two weeks are focused on coding, a project case study, and
            the final presentation, so I'll also work this weekend to create a detailed plan [for these two weeks], so
            that I can create a more understandable, and not-so-overwhelming schedule. I'll make sure to start as early
            as possible so I can get feedback and help as much as I am able to. I'll also apply the fake-deadline to
            these next weeks, so I can avoid task paralysis and leaving everything to the last days.</p>

        <h2>Week Two Daily Stand Ups</h2>
        <h4 class="small">&#39;&#39;What did I do yesterday, What I will do today, Impediments and blockers?&#39;&#39;
        </h4>

        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p class="small">Throughout the long weekend, I got started on developing the hi-fi wireframes, finalized my visual branding, and also I got a start on the styleguide and brand guidelines. Today I will focus on developing my hi-fi, and put some of the branded stuff in. No blockers</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday I continued working on my hi-fi, and started adding in branded stuff [like colors, fonts]. Today I will keep adding, and work a bit on the nav bar, since it feels a bit clunky at the moment. No blockers.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday I continued the hi-fi, and did make quite some adjustments to the nav bar. Today I will have mentoring, so I will list some questions I have, and then try to apply all of the feedback today and tomorrow. A blocker that popped up, was everyone I wanted to test was away most of this week / I wasn’t ready the time they were on campus, so I need to reschedule if possible.</p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday I got a lot of feedback during mentoring, and started applying this, and also doing some reference research again. Today I want to just continue developing, and applying the feedback I got from yesterday. A lot of feedback to apply was given, so I do need to push back yesterdays user testing, but I don’t think that can realistically happen today, since the other people are also occupied</p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p class="small">Yesterday I continued applying the feedback to my hi-fi, and developing. I also finally started finding some relevant images on copy-right free platforms [and experimenting with AI] following the suggestion from the lecturer, so I started putting those in to my screens. I managed to do user testing on one person, so I also started applying changes, and listing things I could adjust after WIPS.Today is my WIP 02 presentation, and then after this, I’ll finalize that and clean up any unfinished works from any part of the project, in preparation for the next two coding weeks. I wonder if I could have just done user testing on the barely developed hi-fi I had on tuesday, and if that would have helped me, because I feel that I was only able to get to user testing pretty late in the week.</p>
