        <h2>Week Three Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. What went well in the design process?</h3>
            <p class="small">While nothing in particular was outstanding this week, I guess I’d say the pace I worked at was very good. I think because I started the documents late, I had myself believe it was due a day earlier, and this forced me to work much faster than I would have. The rush and stress had me really focus, especially during the production days. This was really helpful since during the design strategy document I was really able to recollect my thoughts and understand my own solution on another level. </p>

        <h3>2. Did you accomplish your sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h3>
        <p class="small">My sprint goal this week was to complete the design strategy and pitch proposal documents, so I did accomplish the sprint goal. Something that helped me complete this was having a personal due date for the documents, so that I worked faster, and just did the work, avoiding task paralysis which I was starting to feel early in this week. </p>

        <h3>3. What didnt go well in the design process?</h3>
        <p class="small">Something that did not go well this week was timing. I only really started working on these documents this week, and I feel that I could have made them to a better standard had I started on them the previous week. Only working on them in the week they were due added a lot of time pressure and it was sad because these documents would have been more fun to work on in a calmer situation. </p>

        <h3>4. What can be improved? What lessons have you learnt?</h3>
        <p class="small">Something that I learned about my own work process was that a personal due date really helps reduce procrastination, and forced me to take action. But starting much much earlier is something I could always improve on, I guess since the task doesn't sound big I don't realize how much time they cuold actually take me. </p>

        <h3>5. What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h3>
        <p class="small">I think making myself believe that things were due a day earlier really helped me work faster, and gave me a lot of time to slowly go through everything and make changes at the end [since there was actually time to do so], so I will try implement this into the following weeks.</p>
